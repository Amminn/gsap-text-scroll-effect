# GSAP ScrollTrigger / TextSplit Animation

This scroll animation was inspired by the beautiful interaction on [this website](https://nvg8.io/).  
You can see my version live [here](https://amminn.github.io/gsap-text-scroll-effect/).

My version is a bit different â€” I aimed for a simpler UX. Instead of repeating the animation every time the user scrolls back up, the animation runs only once. This gives the user a chance to focus on and read the content without distractions.
